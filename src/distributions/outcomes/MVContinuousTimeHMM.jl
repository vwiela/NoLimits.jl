    MVContinuousTimeDiscreteStatesHMM(transition_matrix, emission_dists, initial_dist, Δt)
    <: Distribution{Multivariate, Continuous}

A continuous-time Hidden Markov Model with shared latent states across M outcome
variables. State propagation uses the matrix exponential `exp(Q · Δt)` where
`Q` is the rate matrix (generator).

Two emission modes are supported:

- **Conditionally independent**: `emission_dists` is a `Tuple` of `n_states`
  inner `Tuple`s, where `emission_dists[k]` is a `Tuple` of M scalar
  distributions (one per outcome) for state `k`. Given the hidden state, all
  outcomes are treated as independent.

- **Joint**: `emission_dists` is a `Tuple` of `n_states` multivariate
  distributions (e.g. `MvNormal`), where `emission_dists[k]` is the joint
  emission distribution for state `k`.

Missing values in the observation vector are handled as follows:
- Independent mode: missing outcomes are skipped (contribute zero to the
  log-likelihood).
- Joint MvNormal mode: the marginal distribution over observed indices is
  computed analytically.
- Other joint distributions: an error is raised if any observation is missing.

# Arguments
- `transition_matrix`: rate matrix (generator) of shape `(n_states, n_states)`.
  Off-diagonal entries must be non-negative; each row must sum to zero.
- `emission_dists`: `Tuple` of `n_states` emission elements (see above).
- `initial_dist`: `Distributions.Categorical` prior over hidden states at the
  previous observation time.
- `Δt`: time elapsed since the previous observation.
