    ContinuousTimeDiscreteStatesHMM(transition_matrix, emission_dists, initial_dist, Δt)
    <: Distribution{Univariate, Continuous}

A continuous-time Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a finite number of hidden states and
continuous or discrete emission distributions.

State propagation is performed via the matrix exponential `exp(Q·Δt)` where `Q` is the
rate matrix (`transition_matrix`). Implements the `Distributions.jl` interface.

# Arguments
- `transition_matrix::AbstractMatrix{<:Real}`: rate matrix (generator) of shape
  `(n_states, n_states)`. Off-diagonal entries must be non-negative; each row must sum
  to zero.
- `emission_dists::Tuple`: tuple of `n_states` emission distributions.
- `initial_dist::Distributions.Categorical`: prior over hidden states at the previous
  observation time.
- `Δt::Real`: time elapsed since the previous observation.

    posterior_hidden_states(hmm::ContinuousTimeDiscreteStatesHMM, y::Real)

Compute the posterior probability distribution of hidden states given observation `y`.

Returns a vector of probabilities `p` where `p[s]` is `P(State = s | Y = y)`.

Uses Bayes' rule: `P(S | Y) ∝ P(Y | S) * P(S)`
