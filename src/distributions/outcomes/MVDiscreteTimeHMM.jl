"""
    MVDiscreteTimeDiscreteStatesHMM(transition_matrix, emission_dists, initial_dist)
    <: Distribution{Multivariate, Continuous}

A discrete-time Hidden Markov Model with shared latent states across M outcome
variables.

Two emission modes are supported:

- **Conditionally independent**: `emission_dists` is a `Tuple` of `n_states`
  inner `Tuple`s, where `emission_dists[k]` is a `Tuple` of M scalar
  distributions (one per outcome) for state `k`. Given the hidden state, all
  outcomes are treated as independent.

- **Joint**: `emission_dists` is a `Tuple` of `n_states` multivariate
  distributions (e.g. `MvNormal`), where `emission_dists[k]` is the joint
  emission distribution for state `k`.

Missing values in the observation vector are handled as follows:
- Independent mode: missing outcomes are skipped (contribute zero to the
  log-likelihood).
- Joint MvNormal mode: the marginal distribution over observed indices is
  computed analytically.
- Other joint distributions: an error is raised if any observation is missing.

# Arguments
- `transition_matrix`: row-stochastic matrix of shape `(n_states, n_states)`.
  Entry `[i, j]` is `P(State_t = j | State_{t-1} = i)`.
- `emission_dists`: `Tuple` of `n_states` emission elements (see above).
- `initial_dist`: `Distributions.Categorical` prior over hidden states at the
  previous time step. Propagated one step via `transition_matrix` before
  computing the emission likelihood.
