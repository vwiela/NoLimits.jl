NoLimits.jl is an open-source framework for building, estimating, and diagnosing hierarchical
models of longitudinal data, aimed at life-science applications such as pharmacometrics and
systems biology where population variability and mechanistic dynamics must be modeled together.
It is developed and maintained by the
[Hasenauer Lab](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/research/hasenauer-group)
at the University of Bonn, with
[Manuel Huth](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/group-members/people/hasenauer-group-members/manuel-huth)
as lead developer.

## Why NoLimits.jl?

Nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models are the standard tool for longitudinal analysis in the
biomedical sciences, but existing software forces trade-offs between *expressiveness*,
*estimation flexibility*, and *machine-learning integration*: mechanistic ODE tools rarely
support latent-state outcomes or learned components, general mixed-effects packages do not
handle ODE systems, and probabilistic programming languages leave the NLME machinery to the user.

NoLimits.jl provides a single, composable modeling language in which mechanistic structure,
learned components, flexible random-effect distributions, and diverse outcome types coexist in
one specification, and can be estimated with several inference paradigms without rewriting the
model. It is built for mixed-effects models but works equally for fixed-effects-only analysis.

## Key Features

### Composable model specification

A model is assembled from freely composable blocks: a structural model (algebraic functions,
ODE systems via OrdinaryDiffEq.jl, and derived signals); differentiable machine-learning
components (neural networks, soft decision trees, B-splines) embeddable in formulas, ODE
right-hand sides, initial conditions, or random-effect distributions; univariate and
multivariate random effects over multiple grouping structures (e.g. subject and site) with
Gaussian, non-Gaussian, or normalizing-flow distributions; outcomes from any `Distributions.jl`
family as well as observed-state and hidden Markov models; time-varying, constant, and
interpolated covariates; and likelihood-based handling of missing and censored data. A single
model can use all of these at once.

### One model, many estimators

Every method shares a single `fit_model` interface, so inference paradigms can be compared
directly on the same model and dataset without rewriting it.

| Inference paradigm | Methods |
|---|---|
| **Fixed effects** | MLE, MAP, MCMC, VI |
| **Mixed effects** | Laplace, FOCEI, GHQuadrature, MCEM, SAEM, MCMC |
| **Pooled (mixed effects)** | Pooled, PooledMap |
| **Cross-method** | Multistart |

### Uncertainty quantification

A unified `compute_uq` interface exposes:

- Wald intervals (Hessian or sandwich covariance)
- Profile-likelihood intervals (LikelihoodProfiler.jl)
- Posterior intervals from MCMC chains or VI variational posteriors

### Diagnostics and visualization

Visual predictive checks (VPCs); residual diagnostics (QQ, PIT, ACF); random-effects
distribution diagnostics; observation-level predictive plots; UQ parameter distributions; and
cross-validation with principled random-effects predictions for seen and unseen individuals.

See [Capabilities](https://manuhuth.github.io/NoLimits.jl/dev/capabilities) for the complete list.

## Installation

NoLimits.jl requires Julia 1.12 or later. Install directly from GitHub:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/manuhuth/NoLimits.jl")
```

Registry-based installation (`Pkg.add("NoLimits")`) will be available once the package is
registered in the Julia General Registry.

## Quickstart

This example fits an exponential-decay model with a subject-level random intercept by Laplace
approximation. The snippet is self-contained — copy it into a Julia session and run.

```julia
using NoLimits, DataFrames, Distributions, Plots

model = @Model begin
    @fixedEffects begin
        A0    = RealNumber(10.0, scale=:log)   # population baseline
        k     = RealNumber(0.5,  scale=:log)   # population decay rate
        omega = RealNumber(0.3,  scale=:log)   # between-subject SD
        sigma = RealNumber(0.5,  scale=:log)   # residual SD
    end

    @covariates begin
        time = Covariate()
    end

    @randomEffects begin
        eta = RandomEffect(Normal(0.0, omega); column=:ID)
    end

    @formulas begin
        pred = A0 * exp(eta) * exp(-k * time)
        y ~ Normal(pred, sigma)
    end
end

df = DataFrame(
    ID   = repeat([:s1, :s2, :s3, :s4], inner=4),
    time = repeat([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0], outer=4),
    y    = [10.2, 6.1, 3.6, 1.4, 12.5, 7.8, 4.9, 1.9,
             8.1, 4.9, 3.0, 1.1, 11.0, 6.5, 4.1, 1.6],
)

dm  = DataModel(model, df; primary_id=:ID, time_col=:time)
res = fit_model(dm, Laplace())

get_params(res; scale=:untransformed)   # population estimates
get_random_effects(res)                 # per-subject effects
compute_uq(res; method=:wald)           # uncertainty
plot_fits(res)                          # fit vs. data
```

Swapping the inference paradigm is a one-line change: `fit_model(dm, SAEM())`, `fit_model(dm, MCEM())`,
or `fit_model(dm, MCMC())` all fit the *same* model. More examples — neural-ODE models, Markov-model
outcomes, normalizing-flow random effects, count outcomes, censored data, and multi-method
comparison — are in the [Tutorials](https://manuhuth.github.io/NoLimits.jl/dev/tutorials/mixed-effects-multiple-methods).

## Built on the Julia ecosystem

NoLimits.jl builds directly on established Julia packages, so their interfaces stay familiar:
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl) for ODE solving,
[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) for outcome and random-effect
distributions, [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl) for MCMC and variational
inference, [Lux.jl](https://github.com/LuxDL/Lux.jl) and
[SimpleChains.jl](https://github.com/PumasAI/SimpleChains.jl) for neural-network components,
[ForwardDiff.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) for automatic differentiation, and
[Optimization.jl](https://github.com/SciML/Optimization.jl) for optimization — among others.
