# Developers Guide

This page is for contributors and maintainers working on NoLimits.jl itself. For using the
package, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md) and the [Tutorials](tutorials/mixed-effects-multiple-methods.md).

## Scope

NoLimits.jl is a framework for nonlinear mixed-effects modeling of longitudinal data. The
codebase is organized around three concerns: a macro-based modeling language (`@Model` and
its block macros), data binding and validation (`DataModel`), and a family of estimation
methods that all share the `fit_model` interface. Contributions should preserve this
separation and the conventions described below.

## Codebase Layout

```

The repository also contains the test suite under `test/`, this documentation under `docs/`,
and standard project files. Local-only scratch directories (e.g. `benchmarks/`, `examples/`,
`tmp/`) and editor/build artifacts are listed in `.gitignore` and must not be committed.

## Local Development Setup

Clone the repository and instantiate the project environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manuhuth/NoLimits.jl
cd NoLimits.jl
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

`Manifest.toml` is intentionally not tracked, so `Pkg.instantiate()` resolves dependencies
against the `[compat]` bounds in `Project.toml`.

## Coding Conventions

A few conventions are load-bearing and enforced throughout the codebase:

- **Differentiability.** All model and likelihood code must be differentiable. ForwardDiff, the
  default backend, propagates `Dual` numbers and handles in-place mutation fine; what it needs is
  *type-generic* code that lets a `Dual` flow through, so allocate temporaries from the input
  element type (`similar(x)`, `zeros(eltype(x), n)`) rather than a hard-coded `Float64`.
  Non-mutating implementations are preferred where code may also run through a reverse-mode
  backend that cannot differentiate array mutation. See [Helpers](model-building/helpers.md).
- **Accessor functions.** Struct fields are reached through `get_*` accessor functions rather
  than direct field access. This applies internally and, above all, in the public API: every
  user-facing type ships `get_*` accessors, so users never have to reach into a struct with dot
  syntax. Field layout is an implementation detail and may change between versions.
- **`ComponentArray` construction.** Reuse existing axes with
  `ComponentArray(values, getaxes(existing))` rather than reconstructing axes.
- **Formatting (JuliaFormatter).** Source, tests, and docs follow the SciML style, pinned in
  `.JuliaFormatter.toml` (`style = "sciml"`). Run
  [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl) v1 before committing
  (`julia -e 'using JuliaFormatter; format(["src", "test", "docs"])'`), since the `Format` CI job
  fails on any diff. Use v1 specifically; v2 formats differently and produces spurious diffs.
- **Static quality (Aqua.jl).** `test/aqua_tests.jl` runs `Aqua.test_all(NoLimits)` with no
  ignore lists, so contributions must keep method ambiguities at zero, avoid type piracy, and
  give every dependency a `[compat]` entry. It runs as part of the test suite.

See the source of an existing estimation method (for example `src/estimation/laplace.jl`)
for the expected style when adding a new method.

## Testing Strategy

The suite lives in `test/`, with files grouped by component (`estimation_*_tests.jl`,
`data_model_*_tests.jl`, `ad_*.jl`, and so on). Run the whole suite with:

```bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
```

`test/runtests.jl` runs the suite as a sequence of `julia` **subprocess batches** rather than
a single process. Each distinct `@Model` emits type-specialized native code that Julia does
not free within a process, so running all files in one process accumulates compiled code and
exhausts memory; exiting between batches caps per-process memory. The batch count can be
overridden with the `NL_BATCHES` environment variable.

To iterate on a single area, run an individual test file directly:

```bash
julia --project test/estimation_laplace_tests.jl
```

Automatic-differentiation correctness is covered by the `ad_*.jl` files, which check
gradients and Hessians of the likelihood and random-effects terms. When adding a feature,
add or extend the corresponding test file and keep it wired into the `TEST_FILES` list in
`test/runtests.jl`.

## Documentation Workflow

The documentation is built with [Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org) and the
[DocumenterVitepress.jl](https://luxdl.github.io/DocumenterVitepress.jl) theme, with a
bibliography managed by [DocumenterCitations.jl](https://juliadocs.org/DocumenterCitations.jl).
It uses its own environment in `docs/Project.toml`.

Build and preview locally:

```bash
# one-time: resolve the docs environment and dev-install the package into it
julia --project=docs -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(path="."); Pkg.instantiate()'

# build the site (set GKSwstype=100 for the headless GR backend used by Plots.jl)
GKSwstype=100 julia --project=docs docs/make.jl

# preview the built site (a local build writes the rendered site to docs/build/1)
julia --project=docs -e 'using LiveServer; LiveServer.serve(dir="docs/build/1")'
```

Tutorials are **precomputed offline** rather than executed during the build: the scripts in
`docs/scripts/` (notably `precompute_tutorials.jl`) run the expensive fits once and inject
their text output and figures into the tutorial pages via `<!-- injected:... -->` markers and
the `docs/src/tutorials/figures/` directory. This keeps the Documenter build fast and
deterministic. When changing a tutorial's code, re-run the relevant precompute script so the
injected outputs stay in sync. New entries in the bibliography go in `docs/src/references.bib`
and are cited inline with the `[key](@cite)` syntax.

## Release Process

Releases follow the standard Julia workflow:

1. Bump the `version` field in `Project.toml` (semantic versioning) and update any
   `[compat]` bounds as needed.
2. Open a pull request against `main` and wait for continuous integration to pass. `main` is a
   protected branch: it accepts no direct pushes, and a pull request can be merged only after the
   required CI checks (test suite, formatting, and documentation build) are green. This is
   enforced for maintainers too.
3. Register the new version in the Julia General registry (e.g. via the Registrator bot).
   `TagBot` then creates the matching Git tag and GitHub release automatically, and the
   documentation for the tagged version is deployed to GitHub Pages.
