## Why NoLimits.jl?

Longitudinal studies - where repeated measurements are collected from multiple individuals
over time - are ubiquitous in the biomedical and natural sciences. Analyzing such data
requires models that capture both the underlying process dynamics and the variability across
individuals. Nonlinear mixed-effects models provide a principled statistical framework for
this, but existing software often forces users to choose between model expressiveness,
estimation flexibility, and modern machine-learning integration.

NoLimits.jl removes these trade-offs. It supports:

- **Diverse structural models.** Classical nonlinear functions, mechanistic ODE systems, and
  hidden Markov outcome models can be combined within a single specification.
- **Flexible estimation.** The same model can be fitted using frequentist methods (Laplace
  approximation, FOCEI, MCEM, SAEM, Gauss–Hermite quadrature), full Bayesian MCMC sampling,
  or variational inference, enabling comparison across inferential paradigms.
- **Machine-learning integration.** Neural-network components - including neural-ODE
  constructions - and soft decision trees can be embedded alongside known mechanistic terms,
  so models retain established scientific structure while learning unknown nonlinear behavior
  from data.
- **Rich hierarchical variability.** Random-effect distributions are not restricted to
  Gaussian forms; heavy-tailed, skewed, and normalizing-flow-based distributions are
  supported, and can themselves be parameterized by covariates and learned functions.
- **Composability.** Multiple outcomes, multiple grouping structures (e.g., subject-level and
  site-level), covariates at different temporal resolutions, and learned components can all
  coexist in one coherent model definition.

Fixed-effects-only workflows are also supported for problems where random effects are not
required.

## Getting Started

New users should begin with the [Installation](installation.md) page and the
[Quickstart](quickstart.md), then work through the
[Tutorials](tutorials/mixed-effects-multiple-methods.md) for hands-on examples covering
fixed-effects models, mixed-effects estimation with multiple methods, ODE-based models, and
machine-learning-augmented dynamics.

For a concise overview of what the package can do, see [Capabilities](capabilities.md). For
the mathematical foundations, see [NLME Methodology](nlme-methodology.md).
